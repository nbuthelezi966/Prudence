✨ New UX/UI Case Study Alert! ✨

Excited to share my latest project: Flight Manifest Manager (FMM) — a mission-critical dashboard designed for Airline Operations Control (AOC) managers.

This project pushed me to solve complex problems around:
✈️ Real-time data visualization
⚡ Rapid decision-making under pressure
👥 Workflow clarity for high-stakes environments
🔧 Resource allocation challenges
🌍 Global operations at scale

Using the Design Thinking process, I explored how to reduce cognitive load, speed up disruption response times, and create a seamless, data-driven experience.

From research → wireframes → high-fidelity UI → interactive prototype, this has been one of my most exciting end-to-end design journeys.

Key outcomes:
• 65% reduction in response time to disruptions
• 80% increase in user satisfaction scores
• 90% reduction in decision-making time

## 🔄 Design Process

### My Design Process

I follow a structured yet flexible design process rooted in Design Thinking, ensuring that every design decision is grounded in real user needs.

**1. Empathize**
I begin by understanding the user's world — observing workflows, asking the right questions, and gathering insights about their pain points and motivations.

**2. Define**
Next, I synthesize the information into a clear problem statement. This helps me stay focused on the real challenge rather than symptoms or assumptions.

**3. Ideate**
Using sketches, brainstorming, and concept exploration, I generate a range of possible solutions. Here I push beyond the obvious and explore creative alternatives.

**4. Prototype**
I convert ideas into low- and mid-fidelity wireframes, advancing toward high-fidelity UI that reflects the final direction. Each prototype is functional enough to simulate real use.

**5. Test**
I evaluate the design with users or simulated scenarios, gathering feedback to refine the experience. Iteration happens quickly and intentionally to improve clarity and performance.

## 🎨 Project Description (Short)

Flight Manifest Manager (FMM) is a real-time airline operations dashboard designed to help AOC managers monitor 100+ global flights, respond to disruptions, and make critical decisions under pressure. This case study demonstrates my end-to-end design process from research to high-fidelity prototypes.

## 🎨 Project Description (Medium)

Flight Manifest Manager is a mission-critical dashboard for Airline Operations Control managers who monitor global flight operations. The project addressed the challenge of scattered data, slow response times, and poor visibility across 100+ simultaneous flights. Through user-centered design thinking, I created a unified interface featuring real-time monitoring, predictive disruption mapping, drag-and-drop resource allocation, smart alerts, and scenario planning tools. The result: 65% faster response times and 80% higher user satisfaction.

## 💡 Key Project Highlights

**Problem:**
AOC managers struggled to monitor 100+ global flights and respond to disruptions due to scattered data across multiple systems.

**Solution:**
Unified real-time dashboard with predictive insights, intuitive resource allocation, and smart alert prioritization.

**Impact:**
- 65% reduction in disruption response time
- 80% increase in user satisfaction
- 90% reduction in decision-making time
- 92% task completion rate in usability testing

**Role:**
End-to-end UX/UI design including research, wireframing, visual design, prototyping, and testing.

**Tools:**
Figma, FigJam, Adobe Creative Suite
