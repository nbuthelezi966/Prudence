## 📊 The Challenge

### Problem Statement

Airline Operations Control (AOC) managers struggle to monitor 100+ global flights and respond quickly to disruptions due to scattered data and outdated tools.

### Key Pain Points

1. **Information Silos** - Data scattered across multiple systems
2. **No Real-Time Visibility** - Delayed updates cause cascading delays
3. **Manual Coordination** - Slow response times under pressure
4. **Lack of Predictive Insights** - Reactive rather than proactive

### User Impact

- Delayed decision-making
- Increased operational costs
- Passenger dissatisfaction
- Crew scheduling conflicts
- Missed opportunities for optimization

---

- Risk indicators
- Geo-spatial context

**3. Drag-and-Drop Resource Allocation**
- Visual crew assignment
- Auto-conflict detection
- Instant updates
- Clear feedback

**4. Smart Alert Console**

## 🎯 Design Process

### 1. Empathize (User Research)

**Methods:**
- Stakeholder interviews (AOC managers)
- Contextual inquiry (observation)
- Competitive analysis
- User journey mapping

**Key Insights:**
- Time is critical (every second matters)
- Mental load is high (100+ simultaneous flights)
- Trust in data is essential
- Need for quick pattern recognition

### 2. Define (Problem Framing)

**Problem Statement:**
"AOC managers need a way to monitor global flight operations and respond to disruptions quickly because scattered data and poor visibility lead to delayed decisions and cascading operational issues."

**Success Criteria:**
- Reduce response time to disruptions
- Improve decision confidence
- Decrease cognitive load
- Increase user satisfaction

### 3. Ideate (Concept Exploration)

**Brainstorming Sessions:**
- 50+ ideas generated
- 5 core concepts selected
- Prioritized by impact/feasibility
- Validated with stakeholders

**Key Decisions:**
- Dark theme for 24/7 operations
- Color-coded priority system
- Progressive disclosure pattern
- Real-time updates architecture

### 4. Prototype (Design Execution)

**Deliverables:**
- Low-fidelity wireframes (9 screens)
- Mid-fidelity clickable prototype
- High-fidelity visual design
- Interactive prototype (Figma)
- Component library
- Design system documentation

### 5. Test (Validation)

**Testing Methods:**
- Usability testing (12 sessions)
- A/B testing (layout variations)
- Heuristic evaluation
- Accessibility audit

**Iterations:**
- 3 major design iterations
- 15+ minor refinements
- Continuous stakeholder feedback
